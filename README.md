# Taiwan Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Taiwan's Air Quality Index (AQI) data. We obtain the AQI dataset from the government's open data platform, perform data processing and exploratory analysis, and present the results through visualization.

## Features
- Download AQI dataset from the government's open data platform
- Preprocess raw data
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize data using pie charts and heatmaps

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab: For code execution and collaboration
- Pandas: For data processing and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Acquisition**: Download the Air Quality Index (AQI) dataset from the government's open data website.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and organize raw data, handle missing values and outliers.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze statistical characteristics and distribution of the data.
4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use pie charts to show the distribution of different air quality levels.
   - Use heatmaps to present AQI variations across different regions or time periods.
